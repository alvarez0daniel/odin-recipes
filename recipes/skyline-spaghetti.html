    <h2>Description</h2>
    Here's the lazy dev version: Made a Skyline Chili knockoff, but less
    oily.Mixed up loads of dry spices for the 'Skyline Spice Mix' and stashed it
    in a jar. Each chili batch just needs 3/8 cup of that mix. Plus, it doubles
    up as a solid meat rub for steak, pork, or chicken.
