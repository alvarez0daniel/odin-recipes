    Hey, so this week, we're kinda into that whole "milk steak" vibe from Always
    Sunny and jazzing up this wild food gag from I Think You Should Leave with
    Tim Robinson. You know, that dude who used to be a total jerk? He's all
    nostalgic about hitting up Truffani's after clubbing, chomping on a massive
    rare steak with just a glass of water. Note to all you TV and movie folks:
    stick some grub in your stuff, and I'm all over it.
