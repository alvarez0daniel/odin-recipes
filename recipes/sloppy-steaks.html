    <h2>Description</h2>
    Hey, so this week, we're kinda into that whole "milk steak" vibe from Always
    Sunny and jazzing up this wild food gag from I Think You Should Leave with
    Tim Robinson. You know, that dude who used to be a total jerk? He's all
    nostalgic about hitting up Truffani's after clubbing, chomping on a massive
    rare steak with just a glass of water. Note to all you TV and movie folks:
    stick some grub in your stuff, and I'm all over it.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 high-quality T-bone steak</li>
      <li>As needed kosher salt</li>
      <li>As needed freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Tbsp neutral oil</li>
      <li>1 glass water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 °F.</li>
      <li>
        Generously season the steak with salt and pepper. Let sit at room
        temperature for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the oil to a large cast iron skillet. Preheat the skillet over high
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the steak to the preheated skillet and sear on both sides for 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the steak to a rack placed on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Finish the steak in the preheated oven. Cook until the internal
        temperature reads 115 °F, the carryover cooking will bring the
        temperature up to rare. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the steak rests, place an oven-safe serving platter in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the platter from the oven and place the steak on it. Pour the
        glass of water over the steak.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
