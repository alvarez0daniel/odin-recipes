# Odin Recipes üçó

We've learned a few basic HTML tags and elements, now it's time to build something.

## Objective

Simply put, this should test to see if I can build an HTML page that can:

    1. Be viewed in a browser
    2. Display text as an <h1> heading
    3. Display links that can also redirect to other pages in the directory as <a> elements

Those pages other pages will be structured similarly and should be:

    1. Able to be viewed in a browser
    2. Display the name of the recipe in an <h1> heading
    3. Display an image of the recipe stored somewhere in the project directory
    4. Show a list of ingredients as an unordered list <ul>
    5. Show steps to make this recipe as an ordered list <ol>
    6. Link back to the homepage

## Key Notes

I still don't fully understand the `rel` attribute or what is important about it but it doesn't seem to matter so far. I'll add the attribute to links in the project just because it seems like best practice. Let's just default to the example: `rel="noopener noreferer"`. Also, unclear as to when I should open a link in a new tab `target="_blank"`. I assume it's dealers choice but their is probably a rule of thumb to follow.
